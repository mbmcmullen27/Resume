# Resume

If I gave you my resume, this is what makes it! It's a latex document I modified to my liking. See releases to download the final product, or clone and compile using latex:

```bash
# compile? with pdflatex and view with mupdf
pdflatex resume.tex
mupdf resume.pdf  
```

```bash
# get latex
pacman -S texlive-most
